use anaconda prompt for patching .exe file

code:

...base>cd Dropbox\Lab Projects\App

pyinstaller --noconsole AppName.py --onefile


everytime I patch the app it will create dist, build and .spec file.

		Be certain to delete old ones first to avoid confusion

When pyisntaller fails:
	open the .spec file and add:

import sys
sys.setrecursionlimit(5000)

...to top of the code in .spec file

then run pyinstaller again (this time using .spec file)
cpy
The app itself is located in ~\dist\HPP Lab Data Manger.exe
	
Make a shortcut so you don't have to dig everytime.
